# Inventory Management Report

## Overview
End-to-end data workflow for managing and analyzing inventory. The project integrates database management, spreadsheet processing, and Python analytics into a single reporting pipeline.

## Workflow
1. SQL → Store and manage structured inventory data
2. Excel → Export raw data and apply cleaning/transformation
3. Python → Perform analysis and visualization using NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## Features
- Raw data extraction from SQL database
- Data cleaning and preparation in Excel
- Exploratory data analysis and trend detection in Python
- Sales, inventory movement, and performance visualizations

## Skills Demonstrated
SQL, Excel, Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Analytical Thinking

## Why This Project Matters
This project simulates a real-world data pipeline by showing how raw business data can move from a database into spreadsheets, be cleaned, and then analyzed with Python. It demonstrates practical skills for data analyst and data science roles by combining database handling, data wrangling, and visualization into one professional workflow.
