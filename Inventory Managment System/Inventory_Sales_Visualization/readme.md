# INVENTORY_SALES_Visualization

## Overview
Welcome to the **Inventory Sales Visualization** project! This folder contains a Python/Notebook project that turns cleaned inventory data into actionable insights. Using interactive visualizations, it helps understand sales trends, stock levels, supplier performance, and category-wise performance at a glance. The folder contains the code file and JPEG images of the outputs.

## Story of the Project
Imagine a business with hundreds of products, multiple suppliers, and daily sales fluctuations. Raw data alone can be overwhelming and hides key patterns. This project transforms that data into **clear, visual stories**:

1. **Top-selling Categories:** Aggregates total sales by category and displays a color-coded bar chart to highlight the most profitable categories.
2. **Stock Levels per Product:** Shows stock quantities for each product in a horizontal bar chart, identifying under-stocked or over-stocked items.
3. **Daily Sales Trend:** Plots daily sales with markers, highlighting peak sales days and allowing zooming for detailed trend analysis.
4. **Supplier Discount vs Sales:** Scatter plot comparing average supplier discount to total sales, with marker size representing stock, revealing supplier efficiency and discount impact.
5. **Sales Treemap:** Hierarchical view by Category → Region → Product, quickly highlighting high-performing combinations.

## Contents
- **Code File:** `sales_visualization.ipynb` / `.py`  
- **Visual Outputs:**  
  - `image1.jpeg` – Top-selling categories  
  - `image2.jpeg` – Stock levels per product  
  - `image3.jpeg` – Daily sales trend  
  - `image4.jpeg` – Supplier discount vs sales  
  - `image5.jpeg` – Sales treemap by category, region, and product  

## Purpose
This project provides a **storytelling view of inventory and sales**, enabling:

- Quick understanding of sales and stock performance  
- Insight into supplier efficiency and discount impact  
- Data-driven decisions for inventory management and sales optimization  

## How to Use
